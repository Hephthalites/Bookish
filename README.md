## Project Description

         For our project, we opted to model ourselves after a non-profit organization that provides books to individuals in need. 
    This organization's website serves to generate donations/funds or to encourage individuals to contribute their own old books 
    which they have decided to part with. For our commitment to SDGs, weâ€™ve encompassed the first (No poverty), fourth (Quality education) 
    in our scheme of work.The five primary pages of our website are home, about us, volunteer, donation, and contact.
    
        To ensure ease of use and prevent a muddled interface, the website theme has been kept minimal. Playfair Display and Montserrat are
    the key typefaces used. The background is a light beige tone with a dark navigation bar and chestnut rose color hoverings.
    The scope of the organization comprises a registration form. A donation form is available solely for the purpose of raising
    funds and donations. Anyone interested in assisting our organization can do so by filling out the volunteer form on the volunteering page.
    The contact page includes our organization's address, emails, and phone numbers. Anyone can contact us via one of those methods.
